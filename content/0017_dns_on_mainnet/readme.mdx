We’re pleased to announce that full DNS namespace integration for [ENS](http://ens.domains/) is now live on Ethereum mainnet.

This enables the owner of a DNS second-level domain name (a DNS name with one dot in it) to import the same name for use on ENS.

For example, if you own "example.com" on DNS, you can import it into ENS — as example**.com**, not example**.eth**, the latter is a separate name. You can then set ENS records for it, e.g. to allow you to receive payments in cryptocurrencies like ETH, BTC, and DOGE to example.com.

## A Long Road

Those who have been following ENS for a while know that this has been a long time in the making, to say the least!

While ENS launched in May 2017 only supporting the ENS-native TLD .ETH, ENS has always been capable in principle of supporting more TLDs. To expand the namespace on ENS, we’ve [decided against simply creating additional ENS-native TLDs](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/why-ens-doesnt-create-more-tlds-responsible-citizenship-in-the-global-namespace-7e66658fe2b1) and in favor of integrating the existing DNS namespace. We think this approach is best for users and gives ENS the best chances for long-term success.

This plan was [first announced](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/how-to-claim-your-dns-domain-on-ens-e600ef2d92ca) by ENS creator and lead developer Nick Johnson at Devcon3 back in November 2017, with steady progress over the last ~4 years (e.g., see [here](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/announcing-support-for-xyz-on-ens-7f5bc7fe1b24), [here](https://medium.com/@weka/introducing-luxe-on-ens-35a9ee2383ce), [here](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/upcoming-changes-to-the-ens-root-a1b78fd52b38), [here](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/ens-kred-major-integration-of-dns-and-ens-launches-e7efb4dd872a), [here](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/dns-namespace-integration-on-testnet-ethereum-classic-labs-sponsors-with-grant-19d57bf16a8b)).

This new rollout is an expansion of what [has long been possible with .XYZ names on ENS](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/announcing-support-for-xyz-on-ens-7f5bc7fe1b24).

## A Big Thanks

We received generous grants from both the Ethereum Foundation and [ETC Labs](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/dns-namespace-integration-on-testnet-ethereum-classic-labs-sponsors-with-grant-19d57bf16a8b) for this feature. A big thanks to both of them!

ENS is an [open source protocol](https://ens.domains/about) developed by the non-profit organization True Names TLD, and funding has mostly come from grants thus far.

## The Future

This is just the beginning of a much bigger vision for ENS.

While ENS started as only .ETH names for Ethereum addresses, it has grown to be a full-fledged extension of DNS, functioning in parallel and enabling a whole new set of use cases: a portable web3 username and profile, payments in any cryptocurrency, and decentralized websites. Stay tuned!
