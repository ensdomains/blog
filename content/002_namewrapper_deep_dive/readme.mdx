## Introduction

Before we dive into the Name Wrapper, let's briefly recap some basic ENS concepts that will give some helpful context.

The Registry is the core contract at the heart of ENS resolution. All ENS lookups start by querying the registry. The registry is not just for .eth second-level names (like name.eth), but for all ENS names (subnames like sub.name.eth, and also DNS names like domain.xyz). The owner of the name in the registry is also referred to as the Controller or Manager of the name.

The .eth Registrar is specific to .eth second-level name registrations. This is essentially a subdomain registrar for the TLD (top-level domain) .eth. When you register a .eth name, the registrar issues you an ERC-721 NFT.

The owner of that NFT is also referred to as the Registrant or Owner of that name. It can be used to reclaim ownership over the name in the core registry as well (in other words, the Registrant can overwrite the Controller).

As you can see, without the Name Wrapper, only .eth second-level names are NFTs currently. Subnames and DNS domains do not have NFTs associated with them by default, unless a custom contract is created for that purpose.

## The ENS Name Wrapper

![]()

Woah don't worry, I'll explain all of this soon enough.

The Name Wrapper wraps an ENS name into a new ERC-1155 NFT. Any ENS name can be wrapped, whether it's a .eth name or DNS domain or even any subname!

There is a Use-Cases section later on in this article too.

You can take your name.eth…

![]()

And turn it into a wrapped ERC-1155 NFT!

![]()

Let's take our sub1.name.eth subname from up above, and wrap it!

![]()

Now the subname is a wrapped ERC-1155 NFT too!

Those lines you see represent so-called "permission fuses" for your wrapped ENS name, which I'll explain in a bit.

### Registry Owners with the Name Wrapper

How does this affect the core registry though?

When you wrap a name, you are setting the Controller to the Name Wrapper contract. In return, the Name Wrapper issues an ERC-1155 NFT and transfers it to you.

For .eth second-level names, you transfer the Registrant / NFT (in the .eth registrar) to the Name Wrapper contract when you wrap. The Name Wrapper will automatically reclaim the Controller in the core registry too.

Before, there was no NFT at all (for subnames and DNS names at least):

After you wrap a name, technically the Controller in the registry is now the Name Wrapper contract. That means that you cannot interact directly with the ENS registry for that name, because you are not the Controller.

However, the Name Wrapper contract provides all the necessary methods so that you can still interact with the registry. You can transfer ownership, set the resolver/TTL, and even create subnames just as you would normally. On top of that, any subnames you create will be automatically wrapped by default as well!

### States of an ENS Name

We’re almost ready to see some visual examples! But first, let’s get some terminology out of the way…

In addition to all the functionality that the name gains from being a fully-fledged ERC-1155 NFT, the Name Wrapper provides a number of ENS-specific features as well.

It does this with a “fuse” system. Each “fuse” represents some kind of permission for the name. When you burn a fuse, you are usually revoking some kind of permission. In the ENS Manager UI, this is available in the “Permissions” section of the name.

For example, by default when you wrap a name, you can transfer that NFT around freely, just as you can with other NFTs. However, if the “Cannot Transfer” fuse is burned, then the NFT becomes non-transferrable. In the ENS Manager UI, you would do this by revoking the “Can send this name” permission.

As the name implies, once you burn a fuse, you cannot undo that action, until the expiry at least.

The expiry is how long the fuses are active for. The expiry on a name is set by the parent owner. For .eth second-level names, the expiry is set to the same expiry from the .eth registrar. When the expiry is reached, all fuses reset. In addition, if your name is Emancipated or Locked, then you lose ownership of the name when it expires. There is a section later that goes into greater detail about the expiry.

There are also special fuses that determine the relationship between “parent” and “child” names, or alter the state of the wrapped name. A name can be in one of these possible states:
