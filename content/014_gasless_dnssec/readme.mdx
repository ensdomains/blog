Starting today, ENS can connect with any DNS domain<sup>1</sup> for free.

## History

ENS has always strived to support the idea of global namespaces. For years, DNS names could be imported into ENS without a protocol fee, but incurred hefty Etherem gas fees, in some cases reaching 0.5 ETH.

The reason behind the high fee is that a large amount of data (DNSSEC proof) needed to be saved to the Ethereum blockchain in order to prove ownership of a domain. While this still remains an option for people interested, interacting with the blockchain is no longer a required step in crypto-enabling a DNS name.

## How It Works

Gasless DNSSEC is powered by [CCIP Read (EIP-3668)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668), an application-level standard for Ethereum smart contracts to fetch and verify offchain data. It was authored by Nick Johnson, the Founder and Lead Developer of ENS Labs.

In [EP5.1](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/4208408830555077285685632645423534041634535116286721240943655761928631543220), ENS DAO approved the activation of a new smart contract which implements CCIP Read at the DNS TLD level. Having CCIP Read at the TLD level means that DNS records can be verified on-demand via an offchain oracle. The result is a free way to use DNS domains in the ENS ecosystem.

## Looking Ahead

ENS, much like DNS, is a public good and strives to be a core part of internet infrastructure. In order for ENS to succeed, it must integrate with existing infrastructure rather than aim to replace it. Todayâ€™s announcement aims to be a step in that direction.

We look forward to putting this in front of more DNS domain owners and bringing them into the ENS ecosystem.
