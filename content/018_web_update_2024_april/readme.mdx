Web Update August 2023 - April 2024

It's been a while since we published a blog update. Did you miss us?

We've been hard at work since our last update in August 2023. Our blog may have taken a hiatus, but the new features kept coming so this will be a long post. Grab your favorite caffeinated beverage and get comfortable.

## New Blog Portal

Some of our users asked for a new and improved blog portal. Message received.

View our new [blog](https://blog.ens.domains/) portal.

## New Documentation Site

The ENS team has finally put the finishing touches on our new documentation site. Take some time and review it. We've even included some of our event videos inside the doc portal.

View our new [documentation site](https://docs.ens.domains/).

## Gasless DNSSEC Support

We added support for gasless DNS names, both resolving them and importing them. This means they'll show up through the search bar in the homepage with the "imported" tag, and they're also viewable as profiles.

- The old way of importing is still around, and may still be desirable for some users.
- The main difference is that the old method involved issuing a name on-chain, similar to other ENS names except the source of truth for ownership is off-chain.
- With gasless, importing everything happens off-chain, meaning record updates are gasless.

In the new flow, you're presented with two options for importing: Offchain or Onchain. The app provides instructions for each option based on your selection. See example screenshot below.

## New Facelift for ens.domains

## New Facelift for ens.domains

We added a lot of subtle changes to the font, icons, copy, and even included a new vibrant offchain diagram.

View our new [ens.domains](https://ens.domains/) site.

## Ownership Tab

The ownership tab has been redesigned to offer links to the ENS name Owner, Manager, and ETH record.

## Quality of Life Improvements

### Search

The search functionality is now case-insensitive. See screenshot below.

### Etherscan

The Etherscan link in the upper right-hand corner on the name/address page has been added.

### Testnet

A Testnet indication banner has been added.

### Address Records

Profile icons for the Ethereum L2 address records have been added and offer a splash of eye candy. Icons added are below:

- Arbitrum
- Base
- Linea
- Optimism
- Starknet
- zkSync
- Zora

### More Record Data

We added contenthash & email records to the profile page.

## Security Issue - Search Autocomplete

We had previously been adding ".ETH" on the end of names typed into the search bar in the ENS app. This was a very mild form of autocomplete that was a quality of life improvement for the user. However, this turned into a potential security risk.

If someone registers a target's ETH address as an ENS name (for example "**0xb794f5ea0ba39494ce839613fffba74279579268.eth**"), and enters their address into a search bar, the top result displays their hex address with ".eth" on the end. This can potentially lead someone to sending crypto to a scammer's ENS name.

This feature was promptly removed within a couple of hours of ENS testing and finding the bug.

## Web3 Starter Kit: Next.js

Have you ever wanted to quickly build and deploy a new Web3 project?
Well, we've created a web3 [starter kit](https://github.com/ensdomains/frontend-template) just for that which uses the same technology stack as the Manager App.
View an example project [here](https://ens-frontend-template.vercel.app/).

## Evolving Our End-to-End Testing Infrastructure

End-to-End (E2E) testing is probably the biggest pain point in front-end development, given that it involves spinning up a browser which is a relatively heavy piece of software.
Don't forget the need to spin up other required supporting infrastructure such as databases.

This is complicated even further in Web3 as we have wallet interactions with the blockchain to add into the mix.
They tend to be notoriously flaky and it can be hard to keep tests isolated. To achieve this, you must spin-up a new environment for every test run. All of these things add up and slow down the time between the code being ready and it getting deployed into production.

So we decided to take a step back, and investigate our approach to how we write our tests.

Based on our research, we chose to transition from Cypress to Playwright. This has resulted in huge improvement in many aspects of our testing process, from reducing the time it takes for the tests to run, to making it easier for our developers to write and maintain them. This should lead to us being able to safely release more features, or at the very least it will save us some gray hairs!

If you'd like a separate write-up on our testing infrastructure (or have any other feedback), please let us know [here](https://ens.canny.io/).
